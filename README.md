### Visit Dingle Logo

***
## **What does it do and what does it need to fulfill?**
This is my second milestone project where I have designed, created and built a fully responsive and interactive website for my hometown Dingle. 
My goals with this website are to attract new people to Dingle and to present users with the information that should attract them to visiting Dingle.

I have taken my knowledge learned from the first five modules of the Full Stack Software Developer course, (HTML Fundamentals, CSS Fundamentals, User Centric Frontend 
Development, JavaScript Fundamentals and Interactive Frontend Development Modules) to provide a clear, functioning and responsive website that 
demonstrates a proficient use of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The Bootstrap Framework was used along side these programming languages to help give
the site a clear strucutre and ensure the site has a high standard of responsiveness on desktop, tablet and
mobile. The jQuery framework was used amoungst my own JavaScript code for easier implementation of some code.


## **User Experience**
![Visit Dingle - Am I Responsive](images/response.PNG)

## User Stories:

* User Goals:
    * As a user, I want to be able to navigate through the entire site, comfortably and securely.
    * As a user, I want to be able to easily contact the site with any initial queries that I may have, submit questions, and recieve an
    acknowledgement of my message being received, and a due response.
    * As a user, I want to learn more about Dingle and where it is situated, and what can be seen and done there. This includes information
    such as where to eat and where to stay.
    * As a user, I want to be able to follow links from the designated location to the main website of interest.
    * As a user, I want to learn about the attractions the town has.
    * As a user, I want to feel comfortable and informed about visiting Dingle.
    * As a user, I want to be able to access the site's social media accounts in order to learn more.
    
* For the user, the site assists in meeting the user goals by:
    * Presenting a clean website that's easy-on-the-eye, providing smooth navigation with the use of a fixed navbar.
    This enables them to click between the pages at all times. The user can also click on the logo from
    any page to take them back to the home page.
    * Providing a clean, basic form that doesn't overwhelm or confuse the user which they can fill out to submit any questions they may have.
    Upon submission the user gets a modal pop up providing them with feedback that their query has been submitted successfully.
    * The footer contains all the social media links the user will need to use for follwing and learning more about this site.

#### Design
##### Colour Scheme

I chose colors that would be soothing and calming on first glance of the website, and not intrusive. The muted tones give the page a serene look
and feel. This was important to me as my aim was to create an online space that promotes and represents a feeling of what colours can be pleasent for the user to look a. I feel like the light and dark purple contrast
well on the navbar and footer and also the light gray background color is pleasent for the user.

Colours I used are:
* f5f5f5 - Light Gray - Primary Color
* bbbdf2 - Light Purple - Header Colour
* 848d9c - Lighter Purple - Secondary Footer Colour
* 4278f5 - Dark Blue - Button Hover color

The primary colour, Light Grey (f5f5f5), was used throughout the pages to give the whole site consistency. I found that it gives the page a nicer
overall feeling and makes the text less harsh on the eye and therefoere easier to read.
<br>
The secondary color, Light Purple (bbbdf2), was used for the Navbar and the footer. I felt as if this was an appropriate color as it fits nicely with the colors from the festival hero images.

<br>

I also used a lighter shade of Purple (848d9c) for the footer also, to give it nice contrast. I think it went well with the original color of purple I have already selected throughout the site.
<br>
I used Dark Blue (4278f5) as a color for when the user hovers over a button and social media icons, I felt as if it was a nice color to use, it's subtle.

### Font

I decided to use two fonts throught my site. I included these fonts by inserting an _import_ link of Google Fonts API into the top of my html documents<br>
The font I chose for the body text on the pages was 'Roboto', with a fall back of 'Sans-serif' should the site not load the import correctly. I
found the 'Roboto' font was clear, easy to read and fed into the simple, minimal look and feel I was trying to achieve with the site.
 Clarity was important throughout my project and I felt as though Roboto was a safe, reliable font to use.
When it came to font weight, I used to stock font weight for most of the page except the titles , I used the 'large' font size.

###  Logo

The logo was created using an online design tool called Free Logo Design. I created a custom canvas to fit my required dimensions and set the background to
be transparent as I was using a transparent navbar. when it came to designing the logo I typically like a plain yet attrctive logo so I used a simple "Visit Dingle" text in the color white.
i picked the color white for the logo so It would have a nice contrast between the purple navbar and also, the color white looks nice on the raw hero images 
found on the website before you scroll when the navbar goes purple.
It also matched the white font of my nav links on the navbar. I chose the font 'Roboto' for this text to match the font used for headings throughout the
site, keeping a clear consistency. It suited the site's branding and complemented all my other design choices well. 

### Composition

There is a clear structure throughout the site. Each of the main pages has a hero image at the top with some text to engage the user. I also implemented content
hinting on all the pages to encourage scrolling and more user interaction. 
To help me keep the design neat and consistent, I had all content displayed central, with good margins for desktop use to avoid anything being cut
off the screen. I ensured all the content is full width for mobile sizes, utilising all of the space available. I feel like scrolling down 
on the home page ave it a nice touch which greeted the user with 2 pieces of information regarding Dingle.
The Google map on the Dingle page has been set to full
width to keep the map easily readable across all screen sizes. 

###  Wireframes

Wireframes for this project were created using Figma. I did enjoy the wireframing part of this project because that is where I can 
see if something will work or not on the site.
The final pages I ended up with arent too different than my wireframes I believe.
made during the planning stages. Find the links to these wireframes below:

## **Features**

#### Existing Features

* Navbar - Featured across all pages. Site visitors can use the links on the left to navigate between all pages on the website. These links also
collapse down into a hamburger icon at smaller screen sizes. The logo, found on the left, can be clicked on all pages to take users back to the
home page. The navbar is also fixed, which enables the user to easily navigate between the pages of the website. The navbar starts off as transparent,
and then becomes purple as the user scrolls to ensure it is always clear and legible.

* Footer - Also featured across all pages. Users will find clickable social icons linking to the corresponding social media pages i.e facebook, twitter, tripadvisor, instagram.
There is also a copyright section at the bottom of the footer.

* Hero images -  These can be found across the three main pages (Home, Dingle, Contact, and provide a visual reference to what the user
can expect to find and experience in Dingle.

* Home Page - This page showcases a hero image of the fihing port in Dingle as the hero image, then there is a featured section with image 
and text based on the Dingle Food Festival and The Dinge Distillery, the two content sections also have links to a designaed website related to 
the content and then this is followed by The footer.

* Experience Page - This page was created to help the user understand what Dingle has to offer. It makes use of Google Maps API, incorporating
clickable buttons above the map to make the user interact with the map. On the click of each button, markers will drop on the map.
When the user clicks on the marker a little information box will pop up, giving a litle rundwon of the location and a link to the designated website of said location. 
I felt the user would be overwhelmed if the map presented them with every single resaurant and hotel in Dingle, so I used my extensive knowledge of Dingle to hand 
pick 4 of the best restaurants and 4 of the best Hotels around and put them on the map.<br>
I had a major issue in regards to the Google Maps API which took me quite some time to figure out but thanks to Stack Overflow and CI Tutors I got it working eventually.

* Contact Page - This page provides a form users can fill out to contact the site. They can use this for general enquiries. Once the user submits
the form, they will be presented with a modal pop up thanking them for their message and that they chould expect a response. 
This provides the user with feedback that the query has gone through successfully. It is
important to provide feedback to the user so they feel their actions have been validated.

* Back-to-Top Button - Each page contains a back-to-top button that will appear when the user scrolls to a set pixel height down the page, giving
the user easier navigation around the pages and the site. 

* Favicon Icon - When the user loads the web pages, a favicon image of "EIRE" appears in the tab at the top next to the
name of the site. I picked EIRE for this because I felt as if it was a nice personal touch because Eire is Irish for Ireland

#### Future Features

* Gallery Page - A seperate page to showcase images of Dingle and visitors' experiences of the range of activities, drives, walks etc. on offer.
This would give the user a more concrete idea of what to expect from a visit to Cornwall.

* Include more markers and information on the Google Map to give the user an even more extensive view of what Dingle has to offer.

* On the scroll of the page, the hero image would zoom out.

### **Testing responsiveness on multiple devices and screen size:**
I manually tested the website using Chrome Developer Tools to check every single page, link etc. on as much different devices as possible.
The devices I tested this on were: Moto G4 , Galaxy S5 , Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone 6/7/8Plus, iPhone X, iPad.
I also tested my website on my own persoanl devices: MacBook Pro 16", my desktop pc with a 49" ultrawide-monitor, Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra and a Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+.


## **Issues Found**

- the one major issue I came across in my project developement is the Google Maps API, my API key was not working for my project so I had to get a new one which was fine and I had an issue where the map would not load 
so I navigated to the Console in Chrome Developer Tools and I realized I was missing a few semi-colons, full stops and brackets and it worked for me then.

##### Side Note
- I encountered an Issue with my Google Map, where the marker content woild stay on the 1 marker, and also would not close. 
I worked on this for a while with a tutor, and we worked on it for a while but I could not figure out where the problem was. 
I came to terms with it, and due to the time I had left I wouldnt have been able to keep working on itso unfortunately I had to go on without it.
